As a being in this universe, we, human beings, have not only the Physical body that we can see or touch, but also the following:

- Plasma Body
- Etheric Body
- Emotional Body
- Mental Body
- Astral Body
- Etheric Template
- Celestial Body
- Causal Body

of which the Plasma body is adjacent to the Physical body. We call the summation of these bodies "Multi-dimensional body" [0], which can be illustrated as:

Leaving the Multi-dimensional body contaminated is not good in many aspects, e.g. luckiness [1], health [2]. Plus, once you've experienced the state that the Multi-dimensional body is clean, you often times don't feel good when having contamination.

The Multi-dimensional body can be cleaned through, for example, take a shower. And there exists a more practical way, which is casting a decree. Specifically, the decree can be:

> Resonate with The Divine Source (3 times), I channel the light of lucent clear and the light of cyōng nuǎn to my Multi-dimensional body, clean all the black magic, viruses, negative energy, cut off the negative connections, GaNaKuKu, GaNaKuKu, GaNaKuKu...

Few minutes later, you may get distracted by other things, you can re-cast the decree to maintain the effectiveness. Repeat the decree until you're feeling good.

If you don't feel recovered after a long-term cleaning, you have to check, for example, whether you have bad connection to other beings, accessories that are in bad Multi-dimensional body state, which can be the collector of negative energy.
