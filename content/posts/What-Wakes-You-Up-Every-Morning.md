If you are uncomfortable with waking up, you must make some changes to your life regardless of what would otherwise leave it as is. This is the so called //free will//; on the contrary, it is yet another way to experience life to leave it as is. After all, life is a combination of a variaty of experiences, nothing should stop one from experiencing everything.

To me, the impulse waking me up is "building/learning things that are beneficial to humanity".

During my childhood, I feel happy when helping people voluntarily, be it building tools or simply doing a favor. (admittedly part of which are out of curiosity).

Elon Musk is, to the best of my knowledge, the man who has materialized the most regarding "building things beneficial to humanity". I want to join his team such that I can be more helpful to hamanity. Maybe the energy team at Tesla? I believe that Tesla can develop a facility that is capable of acquiring the energy from the space, something like the Wardenclyffe tower constructed by Nikola Tesla. This facility is expected to be more capable than that of solar energy, and I want to join the team building this facility.
